            <p> Each and every single guest that has and will be introduced in this podcast each has their own
                unique understanding of the world around them. I want to showcase all sorts of different people and give people the oppurtunity to have a voice. 
                Although in the world we live in we see so many people having the ability to influence others, most people dont have the ability to share thier views. 
                I believe that it is more crucial then ever to have a platform that really stands to defy against this idea by showcasing how someone truly feels. This is why I intend on gathering guests and people that encompass a wide variety of perspectives and characteristics.
                Simply put, this podcast welcomes all and encourages diversity within conversations to create an inviting and open minded community.</p>
