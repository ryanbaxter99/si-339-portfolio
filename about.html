            <p>  Hello! My name is Tyler Baxter. I am a sophmore studying Psychology at Grand Valley State University. 
                I love going on roadtrips, focusing on cinematography, hiking, watching anime, and creating content for my podcast. I consider myself to be both an understanding and ambitious person. 
                I'm most ambitious about my podcast, The Common Phenomenon. This podcast has been my main hobby for months and I finally have everything needed to start recording and posting my podcasts. 
                I started this podcast back in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandamic as a way to escape from the worlds endevors. As time progressed, the podcast became more than a hobbie and started to 
                became a way to connect with manny different people from around the area and take a look into the lives of many unique individuals.</p>
